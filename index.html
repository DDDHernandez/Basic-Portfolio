      My name is Dylan Hernandez and I live in the Kansas City area. I have been shaking cocktails and pouring wine a.k.a "Bartender" for a little over three years now. I've been in the service industry for about six years.
        While it has been a really fun experience, I am ready for a little change. I have always been interested in websites and thought now would be the perfect chance to commit to learn. 
        My only experience being from freshman year of college when we had a project on wix.com.

      <p>  I took the leap and enrolled at The University of Kansas, Edwards Campus and learning full stack development. It has been pretty fun so far,
        but also challenging as they push you into new waters. Going into the program I barely knew anything about HTML, but before class even started they had us using it for prehomework and making games on scratch.
        I definitely can say I have learned a lot so far and look forward to learning more. Later I hope to be able to look back and be completly surprised by what I have accomplished.
        As I continue the course I plan to push all of my work onto this site so you can watch me grow as a developer too.
